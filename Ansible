## Concepts

From the Control Node, which could be your laptop, or a separate system, which is able to reach the Managed nodes via ssh, run Playbooks to perform Tasks through Modules, on a set of systems labeled in an Inventory.
The Inventory is scoped per directory. So when you are in /foo/bar you are working with that inventory, and when you are in /foo, a different inventory.

Copy ssh keys to the managed node.
