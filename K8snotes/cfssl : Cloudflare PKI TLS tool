cfssl : Cloudflare PKI TLS tool

https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl

I learned about this from Kelsey Hightower's Learn Kubernetes the Hard Way.
It's an alternative tool to OpenSSL for certificate management.

In k8sthw, it is used to create the server and client certificates, which is also called "provision the PII infrastructure".
PKI here means Public Key infrastructure.

What are the tasks of creating a PKI?

Generate keys.
Create a Certificate, which has appropriate identification and duration.
Use key to sign the certificate (CSR, Certificate Signing Request)
Distribute the Signed Certificates to the Clients
Rotate the Certificates prior to expiry, or on revocation 

```
